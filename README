History:
This project was inspired by MXE (http://mxe.cc/) and was made for own purpose.
Now it is the part of simple build server which builds for a few old GNU/Linux
distributions (i686 and x86_64), MS Windows (i686 and x86_64) and Adroid
(ARMv7 and x86). Maybe one day it will be able to build C++ apps for OS X too.

Description:
This project may be useful when you need to build your applications for a few
old GNU/Linux distributions and you do not want to manage a number of chroot
environments and/or use a hypervisor (like QEMU, VirtualBox or VMware) with
full operating systems. It requires significantly less amount of disk space and
CPU power.

Important notes:
If you want to distribute statically linked binaries, you have to check the
license compatibility very carefully. Even if your project is free and/or
open-source software.
